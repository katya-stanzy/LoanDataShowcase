# LoanDataShowcase
Analysis of a bank loan dataset

This folder contains my work to analyse a loan dataset, inherited through an examination in one of my study courses.
The dataset contains 256,984 cases and 19 variables, all with a different level of missing and potentially erroneous data.

# The task
#### 1. Ingest, Explore and Clean.
#### 2. Create and Test (1.) a preliminary classification model with Logistic Regression using numeric variables only.
#### 3. Estimate input of numeric variables into the model with the help of the Average Marginal Effects in SHAP package.
#### 4. Create dummy variables from categorical features.
#### 5. Create and Test (2.) a new Logistic Regression model using dummy variables as well as the most important numerical variables.
